# Python Style Guide with PEP 8

PEP 8 is a code-ifesto<sup>1</sup> that important Python-related people wrote (and most people follow) so that Python code is easy to read and understand.

## PEP 8
* Top level functions (so not inside of a class) should have two blank lines between them
* Two lines between classes and other items
* Methods inside a class should have one blank line between them
* Spaces = 4
* Spaces around every comma and around operators that are not inside a function call
* imports always at top of library
* import different libraries on separate lines
* avoid single letter variable names
* function names are snake_case (all lowercase and use underscore)
* classes start with uppercase
* at least two spaces before an inline comment
