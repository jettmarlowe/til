# Adjusting image size in Github markdown

Images can be helpful when describing a problem.  
How do I control the image size so it doesn't overwhelm the entire markdown page?  
  
## Use the width and height arguments to control the image size

* Put the image file in the same directory as your markdown file.
* Add the HTML `img` code.
* Adjust the size as necessary.

```markdown
<img src="my_image.png" alt="Image description" width="200" height="200">
```
