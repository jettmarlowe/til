# What is a Tensor?

A tensor is like a shipping container that holds the data representation for input to a model. 

The shipping container could hold just one row of boxes or multiple dimensions.  
Of course the shipping container has to be rectangular.

If it is 0-D, the tensor is known as a scalar.  
If it is 1-D, the tensor is known as a vector.  
It is is 2-D, the tensor is known as a matrix.

## What's the point of a tensor?
Tensors are helpful because you can do math on them, or combinations of them, e.g. the dot product.
