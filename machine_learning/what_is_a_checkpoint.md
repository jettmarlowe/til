# What is a Model Checkpoint?

A checkpoint consists of a model at a particular state.  
The checkpoint includes the weights of a model, the learning rate, and other hyper-parameters.  
This can be useful as a starting point for fine-tuning a model.  
It can also save time if you need to come back to working on the model later.  
  
This is similar to [savestate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/savestate#English) in video game emulation.
