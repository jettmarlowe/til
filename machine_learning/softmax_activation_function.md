# Talking about Softmax Function with a Cat

cat, to neural network: what? you delivered log-counts to me? this isn't what I wanted!

neural network: oops

softmax: I can help

neural network: okay

softmax: hand me those log-counts, please. 
         first let's get some counts out of that. just take the exponent of the log-counts. nice work. 
	     then do some dividing. oh and normalize the counts. 
	     now you have a nice probability distribution. 
	     look, it's all positive numbers. and it sums to 1!

cat: meow that's more like it.
