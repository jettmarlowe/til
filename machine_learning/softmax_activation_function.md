# Talking about Softmax Function with a Cat

Softmax is used during model training


cat, to neural network: 
> what? you delivered log-counts to me? this isn't what I wanted!

neural network: 
> oops i'm still in training :face_with_spiral_eyes:

softmax: 
> I can help

neural network: 
> okay

softmax: 
> hand me those log-counts, please.  <br>
> first let's get some counts out of that. just take the exponent of the log-counts. nice work. <br>
> then do some dividing. oh and normalize the counts. we want them to be between 0 and 1.  <br>
> now you have a nice probability distribution. <br>
> look, it's all positive numbers. and it sums to 1!  

cat: 
> meow that's more like it.
