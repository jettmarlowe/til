# What is the Command Line Interface?

Tell the computer what to do using words instead of clicking on icons.  

## Components
The three things that make up the command line environment (along with MacOS examples):
* A shell - [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) 
* A terminal - [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)
* A text based application - e.g., [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html)


## Why does the command line exist?
* Historical legacy - command line was a way to give commands to computers in the 1970s.
* It takes fewer resources to run as a program.
* It can be faster for a human to type the desired commands vs. clicking in menus.
* It is easier to implement new text based applications vs. taking the time to design a full GUI.
